# Controllers

These controllers are placeholders while we figure out what the models are going to look like and just how
generic the resource type handling is going to be.

They also will likely change to publish to kafka with a consumer pulling from kafka before inserting into the
database, but we'll see.  If authz APIs are defined here, we may have to have synchronous APIs anyway.
